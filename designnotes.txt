For the project we have the following situation:

*A birthday party for a dog, who we have opted to call Mr. Biggles.
Offer: come to dog's party
Required elements/features:
    A hero statement
    Benefits/Reasons
    Social Confirmation
    Strong CTA
    Form

The template we have chosen to follow in an effort to reduce the creative load necessary is from the website: https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/birthday-invitation-landing-page_12980577.htm 

A sample is also included in the MrBiggles repo as birthday-invitation-landing.avif 

Within the sample provided are the following features from top-to-bottom,left-to-right.
*Logo in top left corner
*Nav top right corner with 3 list items (home,aboutus,contact)
*Body area is divided to 2 in a 1/3,2/3 ratio.
1/3rd ratio is dedicated to data and information
2/3 ratio is dedicated to birthday pictures
*Hero statement (Happy Birthday declaration)
*Benefit/reasons filler lorem ipsum
*weak CTA lorem
*time/date with emphasis
*social media icons

Plan of initial action:
background picture of dog bones for body.
data 1/3 will remain this layout, picture 2/3 will be the dog picture sized right.

Our hero statement will be "You are cordially invited to join Mr. Biggles in celebrating another year of chasing mailmen!"

No logo or nav will be necessary so we'll cut that out.
Our benefit/reasons side will be div with ul full of activity li that will be present

Social Confirmation will be a line about special guest pet Shepsy Lapid, the made up dog of Yair Lapid.

Back this up with CTA "Don't be the runt that gets left behind, confirm attendance today!"
Followed with emphasized date/time.

Form with: Pet name, Human handler name, phone, email contact, input section for notes about special allergies,dietary disclosures, or behavioral disclosures.
